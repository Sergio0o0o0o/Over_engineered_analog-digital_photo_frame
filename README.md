An easy robotic way to go through your printed photos automatically

Thanks to a smartphone you can go through your photos instantly, everywhere and everytime. Unfortunately, this makes us lose that unique feeling: print memories and make them last forever. Somebody could confute that this is just a way to store useless and bulky stuff, but I found the way to give a "new life" to tons of photos forgotten in the basement.
