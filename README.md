An easy robotic way to go through your printed photos automatically

Thanks to a smartphone you can go through your photos instantly, everywhere and everytime. Unfortunately, this makes us lose that unique feeling: print memories and make them last forever. Somebody could confute that this is just a way to store useless and bulky stuff, but I found the way to give a "new life" to tons of photos forgotten in the basement.

I uploaded all versions of my project becouse I would like to explain you my process from thinking to produce the object.

NOTES:
  - None of this version are yet optimized for 3D printing, I will do that after we solve tha problems that we are able to see in the 3d model.
  - Every version has a list of problems that I noticed, but the las option is just "..." to encouraje you to find more, thank you for your collaboration.
  - Write me if you think you can help me or even just to ask questions about it. I will apreciate it.

V1
I thought that using two different frames was easier, so I decided that the frame had to be equipped with a small robot arm (with 9g servo motors) and a suction cup. The arm is long enough to reach the middle line of the picture box, take one photo with the suction cup (and a small 9g motor with a siringe co create vacuum) and position the photo in the other side of the frame. In this way all the photos are showen and (theoreticly) it should work.
Problems:
  1) very big;
  2) the photos in the middle of the column are showen more frequently than the ones at the beginning and at the end;
  3) too many motors [6] (many things can go wrong, I would like to keep is simple, and it would be too noisy);
  4) ...

V2
The idea was to create something able to take the first photo and place it under the column of photos. In this way each photo will be showen just one time every cicle, solving the 1st problem of the previous version. I thoug about using a long linear actuator with a rubber piece at the and that could drag the first photo down the pile. A small ramp (in the frame) could left the space for the entrance of the photo unther the pile and the arm could push the photo. In this way only 2 motor were used, solving the 3rd problem.
Problems:
  1) very big;
  2) how should the design be completed?;
  3) will it work in a nearly vertical position?;
  4) ...

V3
3rd and 4th problems pushed me to think about a new version, without wasting more time. I thought aboud adding a mooving-bridge stile acruator, to take the photo from the top of the pile (with vacuum gripper) and put it where the linear actuated arm (as in V2) will be able to push it under the pile.
Problems:  
  1) very big;
  2) too many motors [6] (many things can go wrong, I would like to keep is simple, and it would be too noisy);
  3) ...

V4
the V3 pushed me to think again about the V1, a mooving-bridge stile actuator could solve the 3rd problem (the worst). So i decided to give it a possibility.
Problems:
  1) very big;
  2) the photos in the middle of the column are showen more frequently than the ones at the beginning and at the end;
  3) ...

I understand that the 1sr problem of all designs wont probably be solved, I'm over it, but I think that the 2nd problem of V4 can still be solved.

Write me if you think you can help me or even just to ask questions about it. I will apreciate it.
